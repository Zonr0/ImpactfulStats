An in-progress repository for various tools and statistical analysis for use with Mihoyo's Genshin Impact. Code and
subsequent analysis is in a very 'work-in-progress' state and should not be relied on.

Currently, main.py is used for active development for some analysis on wish rates. It will be cleaned up and moved to
the jupyter notebook eventually.
